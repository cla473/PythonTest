Title:      AntiboiticAssay
Problem:    Antibiotics are sometimes tested by 'dropping' a measured dose onto the middle of a petri dish that is covered 
            in a bacterial 'lawn'. Resistance is measured as the area of the disk still covered by bacteria after 2 days. 
            Write a python function to calculate this area (you may assume bacterial death spreads out from the antibiotic 
            drop creating a perfect bacteria-free central disk).Â
